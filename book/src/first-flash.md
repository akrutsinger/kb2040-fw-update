# First flash (BOOTSEL)

The first time, both the bootloader and the app go on the board through the RP2040's ROM
bootloader, as UF2 files.

1. Put the board in BOOTSEL: hold **BOOT** and tap **RESET** (or plug in while holding BOOT).
   It mounts as `RPI-RP2` (here `/run/media/austyn/RPI-RP2`), and `lsusb` shows
   `2e8a:0003 Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot`.
2. From `firmware/`:

   ```sh
   cargo run --release -p bootloader   # once, or when the bootloader changes
   cargo run --release -p app
   ```

   The runner (`elf2uf2-rs -d`) converts the ELF to UF2 and copies it to the drive. The
   board reboots on its own and the drive unmounts, so **each flash needs its own trip into
   BOOTSEL**. Each UF2 only writes its own partition, so flashing one leaves the other intact.

3. The app shows up as a USB serial port (`lsusb` shows `c0de:cafe kb2040-fw-update KB2040 console`).
   Open it with `tio /dev/ttyACM0` (or whatever device yours is). The app prints nothing until you
   type, so press **ENTER** to get the `> ` prompt, then try `help`.

   The port needs the `dialout` group (`sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`, then log back in, or as a
   temporary fix, run `newgrp dialout` in the shell until then).

The app doesn't boot on its own: it has no boot2 and is linked at `0x10007000`, so the
bootloader must be on the board. Until an app is flashed, the bootloader jumps into erased
flash, faults and resets in a loop. That's harmless; BOOTSEL still works.

The [next chapter](memory-layout.md) shows where each of them lives in flash.
